# 3d-print-projects
Collection of .stl and .gcode files of my 3D printing projects

# stl files
.stl files are included so that you can slice them yourself and print them with the printer of your choice.

# gcode files
Compiled .gcode files are only compatible with Ultimaker Mega-S. If you have a different printer you should compile them yourself with a slicer and the .stl files to your own specifications and settings.
